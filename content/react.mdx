# React Concepts and Code Examples

## Introduction to React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page.

## Key Features of React
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates and renders the right components when data changes.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in a single direction, making it easier to understand and debug.

## Setting Up a React Project
To create a new React project, you can use Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Basic React Component
A simple functional component in React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = () => {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};

export default HelloWorld;
```

## Class Components
React also supports class components:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

## JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```

## Props
Props are used to pass data from one component to another.

```jsx
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

// Usage
<Greeting name="Alice" />
```

## State
State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;
```

## Handling Events
React can handle events like click, change, etc.

```jsx
const Button = () => {
    const handleClick = () => {
        alert('Button clicked!');
    };

    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
};
```

## Conditional Rendering
You can render different components or elements based on conditions.

```jsx
const Message = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
    return isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome Back!</h1> : <h1>Please Log In</h1>;
};
```

## Lists and Keys
Rendering lists in React requires a unique key for each item.

```jsx
const ItemList = ({ items }) => {
    return (
        <ul>
            {items.map(item => (
                <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
};
```

## Form Handling
React makes it easy to manage forms and handle user input.

```jsx
const FormExample = () => {
    const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Input: ${inputValue}`);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={inputValue}
                onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
            />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};
```

## Context API
The Context API allows you to manage global state and avoid prop drilling.

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const MyContext = createContext();

const ProviderComponent = ({ children }) => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState('Hello');

    return (
        <MyContext.Provider value={{ value, setValue }}>
            {children}
        </MyContext.Provider>
    );
};

const ChildComponent = () => {
    const { value } = useContext(MyContext);
    return <h1>{value}</h1>;
};
```

## React Router
React Router is used for handling routing in a React application.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

Basic routing setup:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
                <Route path="/about" component={About} />
            </Switch>
        </Router>
    );
};
```

## React Hooks
Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

### useEffect
The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in your components.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const Timer = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const timer = setInterval(() => {
            console.log('Tick');
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(timer); // Cleanup
    }, []);

    return <h1>Check the console for ticks!</h1>;
};
```

### Custom Hooks
You can create custom hooks to encapsulate logic that can be reused across components.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useFetchData = (url) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch(url)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => {
                setData(data);
                setLoading(false);
            });
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading };
};

// Usage
const DataComponent = () => {
    const { data, loading } = useFetchData('https://api.example.com/data');

    if (loading) return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
    return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
};
```

## Error Boundaries
Error boundaries are a way to catch errors in React components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
    }

    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        return { hasError: true };
    }

    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
        console.log('Error logged:', error);
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
        }

        return this.props.children; 
    }
}

// Usage
<ErrorBoundary>
    <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component.

```jsx
const withLoading = (WrappedComponent) => {
    return ({ isLoading, ...props }) => {
        if (isLoading) return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
    };
};

// Usage
const MyComponent = () => <h1>Data Loaded!</h1>;
const MyComponentWithLoading = withLoading(MyComponent);
```

## React Interview Questions

1. **What is React?**
   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook.

2. **What are components in React?**
   Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.

3. **What is JSX?**
   JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

4. **What are props?**
   Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another.

5. **What is state in React?**
   State is an object that holds information about the componentâ€™s current situation.

6. **What is the difference between state and props?**
   State is local to a component and can change over time, while props are passed from parent to child components and are read-only.

7. **What is the purpose of useEffect?**
   The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in your components, such as fetching data or subscribing to events.

8. **What are React Hooks?**
   Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

9. **What is the Context API?**
   The Context API is a way to manage global state in React and avoid prop drilling.

10. **How do you handle forms in React?**
   You can handle forms in React by managing input values with state and handling submission events.

11. **What are Higher-Order Components?**
   Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component, allowing for code reuse.

12. **What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component?**
   Controlled components have their form data controlled by React state, while uncontrolled components store their own state.

13. **How do you optimize performance in React applications?**
   Techniques include memoization, lazy loading components, using the React Profiler, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

14. **What is the purpose of keys in lists?**
   Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, improving performance during re-renders.

15. **Explain the use of the `useReducer` hook.**
   The `useReducer` hook is used for managing complex state logic in React applications, providing a way to handle state transitions similar to Redux.
