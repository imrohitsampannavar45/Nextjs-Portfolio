# Flask and Django Notes

## Flask

### Introduction to Flask
Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It is lightweight and modular, making it adaptable to developers’ needs.

### Key Features of Flask
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- Built-in development server and debugger.
- Integrated support for unit testing.
- RESTful request dispatching.

### Setting Up Flask
To get started with Flask, you need to install it first:
```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Basic Flask Application
Here’s a simple example of a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Routing
Flask uses decorators to define routes.

```python
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return "About Page"
```

### Request and Response
You can handle HTTP requests and responses using Flask’s built-in objects.

```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/greet', methods=['POST'])
def greet():
    name = request.form.get('name')
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### Template Rendering
Flask uses Jinja2 as its template engine. Here’s how to render a template:

```python
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name):
    return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
```

### Handling Forms
You can handle forms easily in Flask.

```python
from flask import request, redirect, url_for

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    data = request.form['data']
    # Process the data
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```

### Flask Extensions
Flask has many extensions that add functionality to the core framework. Some popular extensions include:
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for database integration.
- Flask-Migrate: Database migration tool.
- Flask-WTF: Form handling and validation.

## Django

### Introduction to Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

### Key Features of Django
- Built-in ORM for database interactions.
- Automatic admin interface.
- URL routing and form handling.
- Strong security features.

### Setting Up Django
To start a new Django project, you need to install Django:

```bash
pip install Django
```

### Creating a Django Project
Create a new project using the Django command-line tool.

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver
```

### Creating a Django App
Django projects are made up of applications. Create a new app with:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

### URL Routing in Django
Define URLs in your app’s `urls.py` file.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

### Views in Django
Views are functions that handle the logic of your application.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
```

### Template Rendering
Django uses a templating engine to render HTML pages.

```html
<!-- templates/home.html -->
<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
```

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'name': 'Django'})
```

### Handling Forms
Django provides form handling utilities.

```python
from django import forms

class MyForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(label='Your name', max_length=100)
```

### Model Definition
Django’s ORM allows you to define models to interact with the database.

```python
from django.db import models

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Django Admin Interface
Django automatically creates an admin interface for your models. To use it, register your models in `admin.py`.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

## Flask and Django Interview Questions

### Flask Interview Questions
1. **What is Flask?**
   Flask is a micro web framework for Python that provides a simple way to build web applications.

2. **What are Flask decorators?**
   Decorators in Flask are used to wrap functions with additional functionality, commonly used for routing.

3. **How does Flask handle sessions?**
   Flask uses a secure cookie to store session data on the client-side.

4. **What are Flask extensions?**
   Flask extensions are packages that add functionality to the core Flask framework, such as database integration and form handling.

5. **What is Jinja2?**
   Jinja2 is the templating engine used by Flask for rendering HTML pages.

### Django Interview Questions
1. **What is Django?**
   Django is a high-level web framework for Python that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

2. **What is the purpose of Django’s ORM?**
   Django’s ORM allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects instead of SQL queries.

3. **How do you create a new Django project?**
   You can create a new Django project using the command `django-admin startproject projectname`.

4. **What are middleware in Django?**
   Middleware are hooks into Django's request/response processing. They're used to process requests globally before reaching the view or after the view has processed them.

5. **What is the Django admin interface?**
   The Django admin interface is an automatically generated web-based interface that allows you to manage your application’s data.
